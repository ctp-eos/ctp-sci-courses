## The New Science of Our Dreams

We have a physical or P-body and a non-physical spiritual or C-body. When we sleep and dream, our C-body enters its natural domain or C-
domain every time. Learn CTP Energy Science (CTPSci) details about your sleep and dreams you have never known before.

Learn about the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) part of your sleep when your C-body is always out of your physical or P-body, and what it
means. Learn the challenges how to remember more of your direct experiences in C-domain without Ego Mind translations of such in terms of symbols of physical life up the return. 

Learn how in our dreams we constantly review conditions of events yet to happen in our lives, understand Déjà vu experiences, recognize in your dreams when you are out of your physical or P-body, learn how to tune into any concept and see its conditions and possible realities and how to bring them into your physical domain.

After this course, you will be excited to go to sleep and dream – each time you will pick up more knowledge and more awareness of what is truly going on in your dreams.
