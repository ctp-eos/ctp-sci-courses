## Best Practices

- **Course directories:** Each course should have its own folder (`course-1-beginner`, `course-2-intermediate`, etc.)
- **Images:** Store all lesson images inside an `images/` folder within each course folder.
- **File formats:** Provide lessons in both `.pdf` and `.txt` formats for accessibility.
- **Quizzes & Exercises:** Keep quizzes in `.md` or `.txt` format, and place exercises in an `assets/` folder.
- **Branding:** Use a `branding/` folder for logos, slide templates, and other visual assets.
- **Extras:** Place investor materials, media kits, and LMS exports under an `extras/` folder.
