## The New Science of Our Non-physical C-Existence

For centuries, humanity has relied on spiritual practices and prayer to enrich life and foster deeper connections beyond the physical world. While many have experienced real benefits from these traditions, the precise nature of this non-physical existence has remained elusive.

Whether you are a spiritual practitioner or simply curious, this framework sheds light on how spiritual energy works in a way that transcends cultural boundaries and ancient beliefs, bridging the timeless wisdom of the past with modern scientific understanding.
