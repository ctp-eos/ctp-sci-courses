## The New Science of Creation of Events & Conditions

Most of us make decisions about events in our daily lives without knowing that there is actual science and sequence(s) behind this
process. Most of us also constantly introduce our opinions in the process of the creation of events or judging events based on past
criteria, memories, and experiences.

However, believe it or not, for an event to take place in our physical reality, it has its own sequence of events & conditions that must be created irrelevant of time or our or anyone’s opinion regarding said events or sequences. 

Due to the resistant nature of the Ego Mind - we lose many opportunities or do not create many events and conditions because we do not understand enough about how such are created. Learn about the new science of the creation of events in every new NOW in your life.

Learn how you are not a victim of such events but the creator of them. Learn how to avoid bad events or accidents and sense approaching conditions for such. Learn how to create more positive events and conditions in your life more the time.
