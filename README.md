# CTP: The Ultimate Knowledge About Everything™  
## CTP Energy Science (CTPSci) Courses Syllabus  

**CTP Energy, LLC (CTPLLC)** presents a groundbreaking series of courses that explore the frontiers of knowledge through the lens of **CTP Energy Science (CTPSci)**. These courses bring together compelling topics from new postquantum sciences, higher dimensions, consciousness, contemporary C-spirituality, dreams, thought, event manifestation, the paranormal, the postquantum sciences utilized by **UFOs/#UAPs** *(what we refer to as CTP craft (by name)*, species and civilizations, the higher-self, hyperspatial sciences, the coming **Nth Industrial Revolution**, and more — as interpreted through new scientific understandings derived from CTP Energy and the CTPSci Sciences.

While many people believe in a “higher power,” questions often remain about how such non-physical phenomena might function scientifically. Common beliefs express a sentiment like:  
> “I believe in a higher power that science doesn’t understand.”

**CTP Energy Science (CTPSci)** addresses this very mystery by offering a new framework that begins to explain what this higher power truly is: **non-physical Conscious or C-energy** and how it operates in, around, and behind all things.

With the relaunch of CTPSci after nearly two decades since our initial outreach in the early 2000s, we are entering **Phase II** of a bold new scientific era. This renewed effort promises a deeper, more structured understanding of the non-physical **C-domain**, scientifically, and the influence of **non-physical Conscious or C-energy** on reality, consciousness, perception, and transformation.

This foundational energy exists behind and within all things—therefore, it influences everything. For this reason, we can begin to introduce CTP Energy Science principles into a wide range of fields. Our selected topics for the first round of courses represent areas where the effects of CTPSci are especially pronounced and observable.

## Background & Legacy

Originating with the original **CTPEC Phase I Operations in 2004**, earlier versions of these courses were taught online and through live teleconference sessions. Some were led directly by **Drazen Premate**, the original discoverer of CTP Energy Science, while others were conducted by trained instructors. These teachings were informed by Drazen Premates’s over **23,000 direct experiences** of the C-domain, along with laboratory experimentation and results derived from CTPSci principles.

## CTP Energy Science (CTPSci): Phase II

This new era continues our tradition of community engagement through modern teleconferencing *(Zoom, Matrix, and other platforms)*, and will soon expand to full-scale, invite-only or future public and branded **CTP Forum events**. Phase II represents a new leadership direction—carrying forward the original legacy while presenting a renewed vision for the future.
