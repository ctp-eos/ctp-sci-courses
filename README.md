# CTP: The Ultimate Knowledge About Everything™  
## CTP Energy Science (CTPSci) Courses Syllabus  

**CTP Energy, LLC (CTPLLC)** presents a groundbreaking series of courses that explore the frontiers of knowledge through the lens of **CTP Energy Science (CTPSci)**. These courses bring together compelling topics from new postquantum sciences, higher dimensions, consciousness, contemporary C-spirituality, dreams, thought, event manifestation, the paranormal, the postquantum sciences utilized by **UFOs/#UAPs** *(what we refer to as CTP craft (by name)*, species and civilizations, the higher-self, hyperspatial sciences, the coming **Nth Industrial Revolution**, and more — as interpreted through new scientific understandings derived from CTP Energy and the CTPSci Sciences.

While many people believe in a “higher power,” questions often remain about how such non-physical phenomena might function scientifically. Common beliefs express a sentiment like:  
> “I believe in a higher power that science doesn’t understand.”

**CTP Energy Science (CTPSci)** addresses this very mystery by offering a new framework that begins to explain what this higher power truly is: **non-physical Conscious or C-energy** and how it operates in, around, and behind all things.

With the relaunch of CTPSci after nearly two decades since our initial outreach in the early 2000s, we are entering **Phase II** of a bold new scientific era. This renewed effort promises a deeper, more structured understanding of the non-physical **C-domain**, scientifically, and the influence of **non-physical Conscious or C-energy** on reality, consciousness, perception, and transformation.

This foundational energy exists behind and within all things—therefore, it influences everything. For this reason, we can begin to introduce CTP Energy Science principles into a wide range of fields. Our selected topics for the first round of courses represent areas where the effects of CTPSci are especially pronounced and observable.

## Background & Legacy

Originating with the original **CTPEC Phase I Operations in 2004**, earlier versions of these courses were taught online and through live teleconference sessions. Some were led directly by **Drazen Premate**, the original discoverer of CTP Energy Science, while others were conducted by trained instructors. These teachings were informed by Drazen Premates’s over **23,000 direct experiences** of the C-domain, along with laboratory experimentation and results derived from CTPSci principles.

## CTP Energy Science (CTPSci): Phase II

This new era continues our tradition of community engagement through modern teleconferencing *(Zoom, Matrix, and other platforms)*, and will soon expand to full-scale, invite-only or future public and branded **CTP Forum events**. Phase II represents a new leadership direction—carrying forward the original legacy while presenting a renewed vision for the future.

### Later to come and new additional CTP Energy Science (CTPSci) Courses 

**Future Course Development & Leadership Invitation**

As CTP Energy Science (CTPSci) continues to evolve, mature, and undergo refinement, a new wave of advanced and specialized CTPSci courses is actively being developed for phased release. These future offerings will expand upon and align with the broader CTPSci Curriculum Development Framework, supporting our long-term educational and scientific roadmap.

We anticipate that these new course realizations will be led and shaped by a growing network of distinguished CTP Energy Science Course Leaders, CTP Forum Facilitators, Curriculum Developers, and domain-specific CTPSci Experts. Together, these contributors—each trained in and deeply engaged with CTPSci methodologies—will play a critical role in preparing society for the **CTP Energy Age** and the onset of the **Nth Industrial Revolution**.

Through this collective effort, we aim to empower humanity to reach new frontiers—technologically, spiritually, and consciously—as we advance toward a future that unites scientific discovery with enriched human potential.
