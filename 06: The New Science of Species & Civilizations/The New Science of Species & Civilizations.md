## The New Science of Species and Civilizations

The most amazing CTP Energy science explanation of how and why different species and civilizations come into physical existence on our
planet Earth. Learn how all species come from different groups of C-energy units comprising similar entities who wish to exist as physical species on our planet. 

Learn how there is no evolution or creationism of species of any kind, and how each group of C-energy Units creates its, his or her own reality including the group physical reality of a species. Learn why species appear and then disappear from the physical or P-domain and never appear again in the same way.

Also learn about civilizations, how they appear, last in the particular physical time frame, and then disappear, and why.
Learn how we choose when to appear and under what civilization and why. Learn how Aspects of your Higher Self including yourself appear in different time periods on planet Earth and why.

Learn about great groups of consciousness of nations like Rome, Egypt, Greece, and others and where they are now in C-domain. Learn about Species and Civilizations, millions of them, in other realities created by C-energy, and how one day we will communicate with them.
