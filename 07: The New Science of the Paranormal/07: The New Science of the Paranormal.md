## The New Science of the Paranormal

The very word ***paranormal*** suggests there is **no current scientific explanation** for many of these *paranormal phenomena* many have observed or have the capacity for. CTP Energy Science (CTPSci) can explain all of them, quite simply and very easily with the new non-physical science terms which define **CTP Energy Science (CTPSci)**.

All paranormal events or so called paranormal events are due to the presence or one more or several varying influence(s) of non-physical C-energy and C-domain being a major contributing factor to said events and such events observed that are deemed *“out of the ordinary”* or *“out of the norm”* or are labeled **paranormal experiences**. 

All paranormal events are a form of **C-domain Incursion** *(into our physical P-reality or P-domain)* from C-domain. 

Take this course and learn first about the domains of our Existence, about our Ego and Higher Mind and thoughts, and creation via C-energy Units before plunging into detailed and amazing CTP Energy Science explanations about ESP, Telepathy, Clairvoyance, Out of Body Experiences, Premonitions, Near Death Experiences, Ghosts, Gods, Astrology, UFOs, Pyramids, Spiritual Healings, Telekinesis, Yoga & Meditation, and other fascinating topics considered paranormal phenomena today.

Each paranormal phenomenon has its own CTP Energy Science (CTPSci) explanation and thus you will understand them scientifically after taking this CTP Energy Science (CTPSci) course and thus each of these topics will become normal to you.
