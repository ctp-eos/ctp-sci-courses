## The New Science of Our Thought and Thinking

Thought has never before been looked at scientifically as it has under the CTP Energy Science (CTPSci) lenses. While the cranial area within the skull is the *"seat of consciousness"*, as it were - the majority of cognitive sciences, scientists, and many people today also believe it is their brain that makes them *"think"*. The elusive nature of Consciousness also often referred to as the *hard problem of consciousness* has finally been solved via the non-physical Conscious or C-energy and the C-energy Units.
