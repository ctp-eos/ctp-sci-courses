## The New Science of the Higher Self and Aspects

Your spiritual or C-body has come from a larger conglomeration of C-energy Units in C-domain that decided to split up into a number of
(usually 5-15) individual entities each destined to experience physical life in a different time period in a physical world such as our planet Earth.

These Aspects are individual entities of the original larger group of C-energy Units making up the Higher Self of such Aspects. Each Aspect experiences the physical or P-domain uniquely – there is no returning (reincarnation) of the same Aspect into the same physical world or P-domain.

All Aspects have bleed-through communications via C-domain with each other and thus access to bleed-through memories coming from each other. Upon completion of the physical life by the last Aspect, all Aspects and their respective memories stored in their C-bodies re-integrate again in the C-domain into the former Higher Self, but now enriched with memories of physical lives of all individual entities-Aspects. 

Take this CTP Energy Science course and learn a lot more about the fascinating science of your Higher Self and your Aspects.
